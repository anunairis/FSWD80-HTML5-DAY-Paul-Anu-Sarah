	<h1><b>Good boys</b></h1>
	<h3>Three 6th grade boys ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs, being hunted by teenage girls, and trying to make their way home in time for a long-awaited party.</h3><br>

	<p>The film starts with Max (Jacob Tremblay) playing a fantasy online game. He enlarges the breasts on an orc before getting ready to masturbate. His father (Will Forte) comes in to let him know that he is going away for the weekend and to be careful with the new drone he has. Max's dad then realizes what his son was about to do and gives him "the talk" over it before going to tell his wife, leaving Max embarrassed.<br></p>

	<p>Max hangs out with his best friends Thor (Brady Noon) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams). Together, they call themselves "The Bean Bag Boys". They hang out at Thor's house where they are annoyed by his younger sister Annabelle. The boys then play a game where Thor ends up with a baseball card valued at up to $600.<br></p>

	<p>The next day, the boys go to the skate park so Max can check out his crush Brixlee (Millie Davis). He and Thor are then met by the "cool" boys, led by Atticus (Chance Hurstfield). He brings the boys to a hidden spot in the park where he pulls out a beer bottle. They take turns sipping it, but when it gets to Thor, he chickens out despite bragging about sipping tons of beers. Atticus starts to mock Thor and gives him the name "Sippy Cup."<br></p>
